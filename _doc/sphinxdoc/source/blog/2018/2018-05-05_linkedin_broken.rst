    The unit test started to since after 04/28.
    Authentication is failing. Linkedin changed its API
    and will remove v1 by the end of the month.
    It will need some time to recover.
    See `developer.linkedin <https://developer.linkedin.com/>`_:
    *Effective May 18th, 2018, our Company Pages API will no longer work with OAuth 1.0. We recommend all apps switchover OAuth 2.0 authentication before then.*
